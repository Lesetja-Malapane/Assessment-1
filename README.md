# Assessment-1

* Modify assess.py to solve the problems as stated in the topic content.
* You can test technical correctness by running the unit tests as in the section To Run Test below.
* Please note that some tests may present challenges so I'd recommend carefully reviewing them in solving the problem.


# To Run Test

* To run all the unittests: `python3 -m unittest tests.py`
* To run a specific step's unittest, e.g step 1: `python3 -m unittest tests.TestCase.test_grade_ave`
